### Take A Break

Simple command line app that prevent you from sitting for too long working with your PC

Just a timer that hibernate your PC when the time come :D

Currently experiment with Windows lock feature instead of hibernating
 
  - Hibernating save your current work into for drive
    - Non-volatile, safe 
    - Will take much more time in the next startup, espeacially when using HDD as main drive
    
  - Lock: lock the current session, without any side effect
    - The computer still 'On'
    - Save the time wasted in starting the PC

  - Sleep probably the best option and I am looking for a way to implement it


Future plan: Add config options to exchange between lock/hibernate(/sleep?)
