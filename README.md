### Take A Break

Simple command line app that prevent you from sitting for too long working with your PC

Just a timer that hibernate your PC when the time come :D

Currently experiment with Windows lock feature instead of hibernating
 
  - Hibernating save your current work into for drive, safe and sound, but it will take much more time in the next startup, espeacially when using HDD (compare to 'Sleep', which save your current work in RAM)
  - Lock basically just lock the current session, the computer still 'On', but it will save you some time compared to the current 'Hibernate' feature
